# Progress

## What Works

- MCP server exposes all core Ollama operations as tools (list, show, create, pull, push, cp, rm, run, chat_completion).
- Stdio transport is fully functional for CLI/stdio integration.
- OpenAI-compatible chat completion is supported.
- Configurable endpoint, timeout, and temperature via environment variables.
- Robust error handling and streaming output (buffered for MCP compatibility).
- Modern MCP SDK and ollama-js integration with type-safe handlers.

## What's Left to Build

- Comprehensive automated tests for all MCP tools.
- HTTP/SSE transport for remote/multi-client access.
- Advanced diagnostics and logging.
- Documentation for advanced usage and troubleshooting.
- Continuous integration setup for automated builds and tests.

## Current Status

- Core modernization to registerTool/ollama-js/Zod is complete and functional.
- Project is ready for integration and further testing.

## Known Issues

- No automated test coverage yet.
- Only stdio transport is implemented; HTTP/SSE is planned.
- Error messages could be more detailed for some edge cases.
- Future Ollama or MCP SDK changes may require handler updates.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Migrated from class-based/CLI/axios architecture to functional registerTool/ollama-js pattern.
- Prioritized full Ollama API coverage and OpenAI compatibility.
- Chose to implement stdio transport first; HTTP/SSE is a future goal.
- Emphasized maintainability through clear documentation and Memory Bank structure.
