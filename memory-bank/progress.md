# Progress

## What Works
- MCP server exposes all core Ollama operations as tools (serve, create, show, run, pull, push, list, cp, rm, chat_completion).
- Both stdio and SSE (HTTP) transports are functional.
- OpenAI-compatible chat completion is supported.
- Configurable endpoint, timeout, and temperature via environment variables.
- Robust error handling and streaming output for model execution.

## What's Left to Build
- Comprehensive automated tests for all MCP tools.
- Advanced diagnostics and logging.
- Documentation for advanced usage and troubleshooting.
- Continuous integration setup for automated builds and tests.

## Current Status
- Core implementation is complete and functional.
- Project is ready for integration and further testing.

## Known Issues
- No automated test coverage yet.
- Error messages could be more detailed for some edge cases.
- Future Ollama or MCP SDK changes may require handler updates.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted class-based architecture for extensibility.
- Prioritized full Ollama API coverage and OpenAI compatibility.
- Chose to support both stdio and SSE for maximum flexibility.
- Emphasized maintainability through clear documentation and Memory Bank structure.
