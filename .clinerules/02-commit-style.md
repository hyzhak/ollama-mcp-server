## Brief overview

- Guidelines for commit message style and documentation in this project.

## Commit message conventions

- Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard for all commit messages.
- Prefix commit messages with a type (e.g., `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `test:`) and scope if relevant (e.g., `fix(test): ...`).
- Clearly describe the change and its impact in the message body when necessary.

## Documentation of changes

- Document changes that affect test infrastructure or dependency management clearly in both code and commit messages.
- Keep commit messages concise and direct, focusing on what and why, not how.
